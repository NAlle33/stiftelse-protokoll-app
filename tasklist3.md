# SÖKA Stiftelseappen - Comprehensive Refactoring Plan

## Overview
This document outlines a systematic refactoring plan to address architectural issues, technical debt, and code quality problems identified in the SÖKA Stiftelseappen codebase. The refactoring is organized into phases to minimize disruption while maximizing code quality improvements.
